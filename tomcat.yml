    # If service is set, its value will be used to set Riemann Event service (RES) field.
    # Otherwise, the RES value will be set to the value of the obj field, which is the full JMX object name.
    # This might be important in cases when using special characters (comma, collon, space, quotes, etc) in service names
    # creates issues with querying such metrics. One notable example is Graphite, that uses host.service.attr as a metric path, and
    # Grafana that has difficulties querrying metrics paths with special characters in the service field.

    # Examples: service set to "kafka.broker.topics.all"
